		Hi, I'm Ming Kai Chen. I am a full-stack developer.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a new graduate, I am interested in all aspects of software development.
		I believe a programmer's greatest joy is seeing the entirety of one's work.
		Perhaps I will specialize one day, but I believe building a fundamental of everything is key to success.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have a bachelor's degree in Computing Science from <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/">Simon Fraser University</a>
